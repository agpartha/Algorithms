# Code snippets for reference and continous learning
Intent of this repository is to have code snippets that can demonstrate or refresh the concepts of C language. Full applications and libraries must be housed in their own sub directories for cleaner view.

Keep code snippets at the top level and if we get a library level completion move that to a project subfolder.
