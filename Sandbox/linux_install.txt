pcap_open_live:

unable to cpature as non root user.

Solution:

Do the following as root

Add a capture group and add yourself to it

groupadd pcap
usermod -a -G pcap $USER
Next, change the group of tcpdump and set permissions

chgrp pcap /usr/sbin/tcpdump
chmod 750 /usr/sbin/tcpdump
Finally, use setcap to give tcpdump the necessary permissions

setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
Be careful, that this will allow everybody from the group pcap to manipulate network interfaces and read raw packets!

git:

Unable to push after two factor authentication enabled.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17659206/git-push-results-in-authentication-failed

If you enabled two-factor authentication in your Github account you won't be able to push via HTTPS using your accounts password. Instead you need to generate a personal access token. This can be done in the application settings of your Github account. Using this token as your password should allow you to push to your remote repository via HTTPS. Use your username as usual.
https://help.github.com/articles/https-cloning-errors#provide-access-token-if-2fa-enabled

You may also need to update the origin for your repository if set to https:

git remote -v 
git remote remove origin 
// Did not work : git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git  

you can also do git remote add origin https://username:access-token@github.com/username/repo.git to store your personal access token. 

// Did not work: https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zkirkland/Random-Python-Tests.git
This one works. But after wards you need to add 
git push --set-upstream origin master

may have to do git pull origin master 

try git branch and git pull commands to see if they are fine and test with git remote -v

virtualbox:

Dyanmic size for the harddisk does not mean it will grow unlike vmware. So set the size next in the screen dialog to 20GB or else ubuntu updates will fail.

Guest additions need to be intalled prior to getting resized windows.

https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp46457703730512

Again, as with Linux hosts, we recommend using DKMS if it is available for the guest system. If it is not installed, use this command for Ubuntu/Debian systems:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install dkms

Insert the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso CD file into your Linux guest's virtual CD-ROM drive, exactly the same way as described for a Windows guest in Section 4.2.1.1, “Installation”.

Change to the directory where your CD-ROM drive is mounted and execute as root:

sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Shared Folders from Guest OS:
With Linux guests, auto-mounted shared folders are mounted into the /media directory, along with the prefix sf_. For example, the shared folder myfiles would be mounted to /media/sf_myfiles on Linux and /mnt/sf_myfiles on Solaris.

The guest property /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountPrefix determines the prefix that is used. Change that guest property to a value other than "sf" to change that prefix; see Section 4.7, “Guest properties” for details.

Note
Access to auto-mounted shared folders is only granted to the user group vboxsf, which is created by the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer. Hence guest users have to be member of that group to have read/write access or to have read-only access in case the folder is not mapped writable.
To change the mount directory to something other than /media, you can set the guest property /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir.

usermod -a -G vboxsf $USER
reboot
